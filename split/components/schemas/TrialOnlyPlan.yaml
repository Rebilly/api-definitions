    description: >-
      Use invoice time shift to adjust the invoice issue and due date when
      billing must occur before the service period changes.

      For example, rent must be paid in advance,

      so the invoice must be in advance of the billing date.

      For more information, see [Service period anchor, and billing timing, and
      invoice time
      shift](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/concepts/#service-period-anchor-and-billing-timing-and-invoice-time-shift).
