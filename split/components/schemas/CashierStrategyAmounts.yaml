      This field specifies if amounts are calculated using an absolute or
      percentage calculation.


      Amounts are specified in `baseAmount`, and increments are specified in
      `increments`.


      Example: `baseAmount: 10` and `increments: [20, 50, 100]`.


      - If the calculator is set to `absolute`: the amounts displayed to the
      customer are `[10, 30, 60, 110]`.

      - If the calculator is set to `percent`: the amounts displayed to the
      customer are `[10, 12, 15, 20]`.

  adjustBaseToLastDeposit:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      Specifies if the base amount must be adjusted based on the last deposit.

      If this value is `true`, the `baseAmount` is changed to the last
      successful deposit amount made using [Create a cashier
      request](../PostCashierRequest).


      If the customer has no successful deposits, `baseAmount` is not adjusted.
