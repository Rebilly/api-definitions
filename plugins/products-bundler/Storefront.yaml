    # Warning

    The Rebilly Storefront API is experimental and subject to change.

    # Introduction

    The Rebilly Storefront API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's Storefront API.
