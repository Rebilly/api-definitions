  title: Rebilly Experimental Reports API
  description: |
    # Introduction

    This API is experimental and likely to change.  We would appreciate
    feedback.

    # Authentication

    This topic describes the different forms of authentication that are available in the Rebilly API, and how to use them.

    Rebilly offers four forms of authentication: secret key, publishable key,
    JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.

    - Secret API key: Use to make requests from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
    - Publishable API key: Use in your client-side code to tokenize payment information.
    - JWT: Use to make short-life tokens that expire after a set period of time.
