  title: Rebilly Experimental Reports API
  description: |
    # Introduction

    This API is experimental and likely to change.  We would appreciate
    feedback.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
    You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
    need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
    Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

    Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.
    - [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure
    - [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for requests from the client side.
    - [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time

    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
