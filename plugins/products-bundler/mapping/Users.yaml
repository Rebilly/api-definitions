  title: Rebilly User API
  description: |
    # Introduction
    This document covers APIs mostly intended for consumption by Rebilly's
    Frontend GUI [app](https://app.rebilly.com).  However, any client is welcome
    to use these APIs.  Our main API docs can be [found here](https://api-reference.rebilly.com/).

    The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
    you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
    or [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).

    # Authentication

    This topic describes the different forms of authentication that are available in the Rebilly API, and how to use them.

    Rebilly offers four forms of authentication: secret key, publishable key,
    JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.

    - Secret API key: Use to make requests from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
    - Publishable API key: Use in your client-side code to tokenize payment information.
    - JWT: Use to make short-life tokens that expire after a set period of time.

    ## Manage API keys

    To create or manage API keys, select one of the following:

    - Use the Rebilly UI: In the left navigation bar, click **Automations**, **Integrations**, **Custom integrations**, then click **API keys**.
    - Use the Rebilly API: go to [API Keys](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/API-Keys).

    For more information, see [API keys](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/concepts-and-features/concept/api-keys).

    # SDKs

    ## Javascript SDK

    Installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/sdks).
    SDK code examples are included in these docs.

    ## PHP SDK
    For all PHP SDK examples provided in this spec you will need to configure `$client`.
    You may do it like this:

    ```php
    $client = new Rebilly\Client([
        'apiKey' => 'YourApiKeyHere',
        'baseUrl' => 'https://api.rebilly.com',
    ]);
    ```

    # Using filter with collections
    Rebilly provides collections filtering. You can use `?filter` param on collection to define which records should be shown in the response.

    Here is filter format description:

    - Fields and values in filter are separated with `:`: `?filter=firstName:John`.

    - Fields in filter are separated with `;`: `?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe`.

    - You can use multiple values using `,` as values separator: `?filter=firstName:John,Bob`.

    - To negate the filter use `!`: `?filter=firstName:!John`. Note that you can negate multiple values like this: `?filter=firstName:!John,Bob`. This filter rule will exclude all Johns and Bobs from the response.

    - You can use range filters like this: `?filter=amount:1..10`.

    - You can use gte (greater than or equals) filter like this: `?filter=amount:1..`, or lte (less than or equals) than filter like this: `?filter=amount:..10`.

    - You can create some [predefined values lists](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/Lists) and use them in filter: `?filter=firstName:@yourListName`. You can also exclude list values: `?filter=firstName:!@yourListName`.
