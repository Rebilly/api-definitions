  description: |-
    Updates the status of a payout request allocation with a specified ID.

    Only the `processing` and `canceled` statuses can be set with this operation.
    The `processing` status transitions an allocation from `pending` when payment processing begins.
    The `canceled` status stops the allocation before it is processed.

    The `completed` and `failed` statuses are set automatically during transaction processing.
    Allocations are always created in the `pending` status.

                New status for the allocation.
                Use `processing` to move an allocation from `pending` to `processing`,
                which begins payment processing.
                Use `canceled` to stop the allocation before it is processed.
