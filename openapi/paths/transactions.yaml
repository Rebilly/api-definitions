    Create a transactions of type `sale`, `authorize`, or `credit`.
    This endpoint supports two main styles of transactions:
      1. A real-time decision and response.
      2. User approval/interaction is required.

    A real-time decision is very familiar.  You send a request, and
    inspect the `result` of the response for `approved` or `declined`.

    However, many transactions, especially those for alternative
    methods, require the user to interact with a 3rd party.  You
    may be able to envision PayPal, for example, the user must
    give permission to complete the payment (or accept the
    billing agreement).

    Even payment cards may require user approval in the case of
    3D secure authentication.  In the event that approval is
    required, you will receive a response back and notice
    that the `result` is `unknown`.  You will find that the
    `status` is `waiting-approval`. And you will find in the
    `_links` section of the response a link for the `approvalUrl`.

    In this case you would either open the `approvalUrl` in an
    iframe or in a pop (better workflow for mobile).
