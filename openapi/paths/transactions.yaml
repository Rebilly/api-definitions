  description: |-
    Creates a transaction of type `sale`, `authorize` or `setup`.

    Use this operation for the following transactions.

    #### Real-time decision and response

    In this transaction, you send a request and inspect the `result` of the response for `approved` or `declined`.

    #### User approval/interaction required

    In this transaction, user approval is required to complete the transaction.
    User approval generally requires the user to interact with a third party,
    and is common in many transactions for alternative methods.
    For example, PayPal requires user permission to complete a payment or to accept a billing agreement.
    Payment cards may also require user approval for 3D secure authentication.

    If approval is required, you receive a response with a `result` value of `unknown` and a `status` value of `waiting-approval`.
    The `_links` property of the response has a link for the `approvalUrl`.
    Open the `approvalUrl` in an iframe or in a pop. A pop is a better workflow for mobile devices.
