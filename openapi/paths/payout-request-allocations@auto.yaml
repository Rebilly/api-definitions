  summary: Create an automatic payout request allocation
  operationId: PostPayoutRequestAutoAllocation
  x-sdk-operation-name: autoAllocate
  description: |-
    Creates an automatic payout request allocation using system-selected parameters.  
    Only the payout request ID is required; all allocation details are determined automatically.
    
    When an allocation is created, the payout request transitions to the `in-progress` status,
    and the allocation starts in the `pending` status.
    The allocation transitions to the `processing` status when payment processing begins.
