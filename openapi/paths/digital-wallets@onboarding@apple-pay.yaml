    [Rebilly's Apple Pay merchant domain verification file](https://www.rebilly.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association)
    and host it on your domain at https://{DOMAIN}/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.
    Then use this endpoint to register the domain, or check if it is already registered.
