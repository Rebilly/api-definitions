    Create a transaction (or series of transactions) according to the gateway accounts setup instructions.
    Ideas of setup instructions:
      - do a 3DS authentication, then $1 auth + void
      - do a $0 verification
      - do nothing (some gateways don't support special types like `auth` and `void`)
