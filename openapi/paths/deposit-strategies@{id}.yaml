  description: |-
    Creates or updates (upserts) a deposit amount strategy with a specified ID.

    Use deposit amount strategies to determine the amounts presented to customers in deposit forms, based on currency, customer segmentation (tags), or prior deposit behavior.

    When more than one deposit amount strategy applies to a deposit request,
    the deposit amount strategy with the greater `priority` value is applied.
