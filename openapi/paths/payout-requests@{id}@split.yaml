  summary: Request a payout request split
  operationId: PostPayoutRequestSplit
  x-sdk-operation-name: split
  description: |-
    Splits a pending payout request into two or more separate requests.
    Provide an array of amounts; one new payout request is created per amount.
    The original request amount is reduced by the sum of the amounts and transitions to the `split` status.
    The total of the provided amounts must be less than the original amount.
    The remaining amount remains in the original request.
    This operation returns the newly created payout requests.
