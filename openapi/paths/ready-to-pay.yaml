  description: |-
    Retrieves available payment methods for a specific transaction or purchase.

    The order in which the payment methods are displayed to the customer should be the same as the order in the response.

    The list of payment methods is generated from available gateway accounts and the last matched `adjust-ready-to-pay` action on the `ready-to-pay-requested` event.
    If no rules match for the specific request, all methods supported by the gateway accounts are sent.

    To invert this behavior, place an all matching rule at the end of the `ready-to-pay-requested` event in the rules engine,
    and include an empty `paymentMethods` property for the `adjust-ready-to-pay` action.

    For more information, see [Update event rules](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/rules#operation/PutEventRule) and [Gateway accounts](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/gateway-accounts).
