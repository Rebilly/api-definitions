    Create a KYC Request.
    Then, redirect the customer to the `kycGatherer` link.
    After the customer completes the KYC process, the browser redirects back to the `redirectUrl`.
    Corresponding webhooks (such as KYC document accepted, KYC document rejected) are sent to webhooks subscribers.
    When the complete list of documents is received and accepted, the KYC request fulfilled webhook is sent to subscribers.
    If a `credit-file-proof` is successful with the decision `single-source` or `dual-source`, then corresponding `identity-proof` and `address-proof` documents are not requested.
