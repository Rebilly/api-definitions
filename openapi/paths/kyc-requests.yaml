    Creates a KYC request.

    The customer is redirected to the `kycGatherer` link.
    After the customer completes the KYC process,
    they are redirected back to the `redirectUrl` link.

    Corresponding webhooks, such as: KYC document accepted and KYC document rejected,
    are sent to the subscribers.

    When the complete list of documents is received and accepted,
    the KYC request fulfilled webhook is sent to subscribers.

    If a `credit-file-proof` request is successful,
    it returns a `decision` value of `single-source` or `dual-source`.
    The corresponding `identity-proof` and `address-proof` documents are not requested.

              In the sandbox environment, to mark a `credit-file-proof` KYC document as `accepted`,
              pass the customer's first name to the `accept` field.
              If an incorrect first name is passed, the document is rejected.
