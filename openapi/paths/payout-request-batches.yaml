  summary: Create a payout request batch
  operationId: PostPayoutRequestBatch
  x-sdk-operation-name: create
  description: |-
    Creates a batch of payout requests for batch processing.

    The batch links multiple payout requests together so they can be auto-allocated and processed together.
    Each payout request can be assigned to only one batch.
    If any of the specified payout requests are already included in another batch, the operation returns a 409 Conflict error.
