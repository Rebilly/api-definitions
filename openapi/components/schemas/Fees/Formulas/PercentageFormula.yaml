      Rounding reduces amounts to 2 decimal places.
      - `up`: Rounds the amount up to the nearest value.

        Examples: $0.011 becomes $0.02, and $0.019 becomes $0.02.
      - `down`: Rounds the amount down to the nearest value.
        Also know as floor rounding.
        Examples: $0.011 becomes $0.01, and $0.019 becomes $0.01.
      - `regular`: Rounds the amount up if the value is 5 or greater and down if less than 5.
        Examples: $0.011 becomes $0.01, $0.019 becomes $0.02, and $0.015 becomes $0.02.
