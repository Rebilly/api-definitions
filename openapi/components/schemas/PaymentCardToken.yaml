title: Payment card token
description: |-
  Creates a payment card token.
  A payment card token is a string that represents a customer's payment card details.
  It can be used once, and expires upon first use or within 30 minutes of token creation.
  To generate a full payment card token, you must provide the `billingAddress`.
  If `billingAddress` is not provided, the token can not be used for payments.
