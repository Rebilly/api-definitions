          This parameter respects the following logic:

          - When not passed then applied coupons will not be changed.

          - When empty array passed then all applied coupon redemptions will be
          canceled.

          - When list of coupons is passed then not applied yet coupons will be
          applied, already applied coupons will not change their state, applied
          coupons that are not presented in passed list will be canceled.

          If coupons will change before the quote is accepted the final discount
          might differ.
