            MRR categories are described below.
            The difference between current period MRR and previous period MRR is equal to `new + reactivated + expanded - contracted - churned`.

            new:
              description: |-
                MRR of new customers.

            reactivation:
              description: |-
                Previous customer stops being a customer for a period.
                The same customer signs up again and purchases a $25 per month plan. This is reactivation MRR of $25.

            churned:
              description: |-
                Customer decides to cancel.
                The subscription churns, the customer goes from $80 per month to $0 per month. This is $80 of churned MRR.

              format: double
              example: 80.0
            contraction:
              description: |-
                Existing customers who changed items which resulted in a smaller MRR. Contraction MRR is the difference.
                Example: A customer at $100 in MRR changes to $80 in MRR. This contraction MRR is $20.

            expansion:
              description: |-
                Existing customers who changed items which resulted in a bigger MRR.
                Example: A customer upgrades from a plan that is $40 per month to a plan that is $100 per month. This is an expansion MRR of $60.
