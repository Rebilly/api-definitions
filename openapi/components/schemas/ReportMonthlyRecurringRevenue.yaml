        breakdown:
          description: |
            MRR could be broken down in several categories, described below.
            The difference between current period MRR and previous period MRR would be equal to `new + reactivated + expanded - contracted - churned`.

            new:
              description: |
                MRR of new customers who didn't have revenue before they placed an order.
                For example, Sally is a new customer who signed up and is at $40/month plan is $40 in new MRR.

            reactivated:
              description: |
                Sally came back after previously being a customer (she churned in the past).
                She purchases the $25/month plan. This is reactivation MRR, and is at $25.

            churned:
              description: |
                Sally decides to cancel.
                When the subscription churns, she went from $80/month to $0/month, and that is $80 of churned MRR.

            contracted:
              description: |
                Existing customers who did a change items which resulted in a smaller MRR. The contraction MRR is the difference.
                For example, Sally was at $100 in MRR, and changed to $80 in MRR. The contraction MRR is $20.

            expanded:
              description: |
                Existing customers who did a change items which resulted in a bigger MRR.
                Sally upgraded to a plan that's $100/month. She was at $40/month, so the expansions MRR is $60.
