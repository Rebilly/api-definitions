            new:
              description: |-
                Occurs when new customers sign up.
                New MRR is the amount of the new customer's subscription.

                Example: A new customer signs up to a $40 per month plan.
                This is a new MRR amount of $40.

              example: 40.0
            reactivation:
              description: |-
                Occurs when a customer stops being a customer for a period but later signs up again.
                Reactivation MRR is the amount of the customer's new subscription.

                Example: A customer cancels their subscription, but signs up again and purchases a $25 per month plan.
                This is a reactivation MRR amount of $25.
              type: number

            churned:
              description: |-
                Occurs when a subscription is churned.
                Churn occurs when the paid service period on a subscription order expires.
                Churned MRR is the amount that is lost as a result of the churned subscription.

                Example: When a subscription is churned, the value of a subscription goes from $80 per month to $0 per month.
                This is a churned MRR amount of $80.
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 80.0
            contraction:
              description: |-
                Occurs when an existing customer changes items which result in a smaller MRR.
                Contraction MRR is the amount before the change minus the amount and after the change.

                Example: A customer downgrades from a plan that is $100 per month to plan that is $80 per month.
                This is a contraction MRR amount of $20.
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 20.0
            expansion:
              description: |-
                Occurs when existing customers change items which result in a bigger MRR.
                Expansion MRR is the amount after the change minus the amount and before the change.

                Example: A customer upgrades from a plan that is $40 per month to a plan that is $100 per month.
                This is an expansion MRR amount of $60.
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 60.0
