    description: |-
      Use invoice time shift to adjust the invoice issue and due date
      when billing must occur before the service period changes.
      For example, rent must be paid in advance, so the invoice must
      be in advance of the billing date. For more information, see
      [Service period anchor, and billing timing, and invoice time shift](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/concepts/#service-period-anchor-and-billing-timing-and-invoice-time-shift).
