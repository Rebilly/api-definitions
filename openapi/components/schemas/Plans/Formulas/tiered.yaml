          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold within defined quantity ranges, or tiers.

          For example, a software company charges $15 for an individual user,
          and $20 per user for a basic plan which provides 2 to 5 user licenses.
          If the customer adds a total of 6 or more users,
          the fee for the sixth user, and each user after that point is $25.

          Price per user  | Max quantity | Description
          ----------------|--------------|------------
          $15             | 1            | 1
          $20             | 5            | 2 to 5
          $25             | null         | 6 or more

          If a customer buys 6 user licenses on the tiered pricing plan, the pricing is as follows:

          - User #1: $15
          - User #2: $20
          - User #3: $20
          - User #4: $20
          - User #5: $20
          - User #6: $25
          - User #7: $25

          Total cost: $145.
