          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold within defined quantity ranges, or tiers.
          If a customer buys a number of units that span more than one tier,
          the total cost is calculated based on the cost of the units in each tier.

          For example, a software company sells user licenses based on the following:

          Tier | Price per user | Max quantity | Description
          -----|----------------|--------------|------------
          1    | $40            | 3            | 1 to 3 user licenses
          2    | $30            | 5            | 5 to 8 user licenses
          3    | $15            | null         | 9 or more user licenses

          If a customer buys 10 user licenses, the pricing is as follows:
          - 3 licenses at tier 1 (3 x $40) is 120
          - 5 licenses at tier 2 (5 x $30) is 150
          - 2 licenses at tier 3 (2 x $15) is 30

          Total cost = $330

          Formula: `(price for the tier x quantity within the tier)` + `(price for next tier x quantity in next tier)` + `...` = final price.

                If this value is `null`, no limit is in place.

                This value starts from the end of the previous quantity range.
                If there are no previous quantity ranges,
                this value starts at 1.
