          The price brackets, along with the price formula,

          is used to calculate the amount to charge for the product on this plan
          on the invoice.


          The "tiered" example:


          Price per apple | Max quantity | Description

          ----------------|--------------|------------

          $5              | 1            | 1

          $4              | 5            | 2 to 5

          $3              | null         | 6 or more


          If someone bought 1 apple, it would be $5.


          If someone bought 2 apples, it would be $9. $5 per apple for the first
          apple, then $4 per apple for the 2nd to 5th apple.

                If the value is `null`, it's assumed to be infinite.  It starts
                at the end of the previous bracket.

                If there is no previous bracket, it starts at 1.
