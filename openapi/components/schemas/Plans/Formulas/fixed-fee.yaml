          Use this formula to charge for subscriptions that have a fixed price,
          number of units, and reoccur over a fixed period of time,
          such as every: day, week, month, year, or number of years.

          For example, a streaming company charges customers $13.99 each month for subscription period that is 6 months in duration.
          The quantity of movies that a customer streams each month does not impact the price.
