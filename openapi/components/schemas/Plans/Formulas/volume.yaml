          The "volume" example:


          Price per apple | Max quantity | Description

          ----------------|--------------|------------

          $5              | 1            | 1

          $4              | 5            | 2 to 5

          $3              | null         | 6 or more


          If someone bought 1 apple, it would be $5.


          If someone bought 2 apples, it would be $8. For 2 to 5 apples, the
          price is $4 per apple.

                If the value is `null`, it's assumed to be infinite.  It starts
                at the end of the previous bracket.

                If there is no previous bracket, it starts at 1.
