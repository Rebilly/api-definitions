          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold in bulk, or volume ranges.
          In general, this formula means that a customer pays less per unit when they buy a large volume of units.

          For example, based on the table below,
          if a customer buys 6 units, they pay $3 per unit.
          If a customer buys 1 unit, they pay $5.
          If a customer buys 3 units, they pay $4 per unit.
