          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold in bulk, or volume ranges.
          This formula enables customers to pays less per unit when they buy a large volume of units.
          Unit cost is based on the highest volume range, and does not include lower volume range pricing.

          For example, a company sells t-shirts in the following volume ranges:

          Price per unit| Max quantity | Description
          --------------|--------------|------------
          $10           | 1            | 1 t-shirt
          $8            | 5            | 2 to 5 t-shirts
          $4            | null         | 6 or more t-shirts

          - If a customer buys 1 unit, they pay $10.
          - If a customer buys 3 units, they pay $24 per unit, which is $8 per unit.
          - If a customer buys 10 units, they pay $40, which is $4 per unit.

                If this value is `null`, no limit is in place.

                This value starts from the end of the previous quantity range.
                If there are no previous quantity ranges,
                this value starts at 1.
