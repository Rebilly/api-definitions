          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold in specific quantity ranges.

          For example, a bank charges a merchant based on the number of transactions they complete each month.

          Price total | Max quantity | Description
          ------------|--------------|------------
          $50         | 1000         | Up to 1000 transactions
          $100        | 1500         | Between 1000 and 1500 transactions
          $200        | 3000         | Between 1500 and 3000 transactions
          $500        | null         | More than 3000 transactions

          - If the merchant completes 900 transaction in a month, they are charged $50.
          - If the merchant completes 1001 transaction in a month, they are charged $100.
          - If the merchant completes 2500  transaction in a month, they are charged $200.
          - If the merchant completes more than 3000 transaction in a month, they are charged $500.
