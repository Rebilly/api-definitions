          The price brackets, along with the price formula,

          is used to calculate the amount to charge for the product on this plan
          on the invoice.


          The "stairstep" example:


          Price total | Max quantity | Description

          ------------|--------------|------------

          $5          | 1            | 1

          $13         | 5            | 2 to 5

          $30         | null         | 6 or more


          If someone bought 1 apple, it would be $5.


          If someone bought 2 apples, it would be $13. For 2 to 5 apples, the
          price is $13 in any case.

                If the value is `null`, it's assumed to be infinite.  It starts
                at the end of the previous bracket.

                If there is no previous bracket, it starts at 1.
