          Use this formula to charge for units that are sold in specific quantity ranges.

          For example, a company sells units in the following ranges.

          Price total | Max quantity | Description
          ------------|--------------|------------
          $5          | 1            | 1
          $13         | 5            | 2 to 5
          $30         | null         | 6 or more

          If a customer buys one unit, they pay $5.
          If a customer buys four units, they pay $13.
          If a customer buys six or more units, they pay $30.

                If this value is `null`, no limit is in place.

                This value starts from the end of the previous quantity range.
                If there are no previous quantity ranges,
                this value starts at 1.
