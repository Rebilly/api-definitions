      Price formula that determines which algorithm is used to calculate the invoice price based on the following factors:

      - Quantity in the order.
        This value may be variable if you are charging based on usage.
        If you are not charging based on usage,
        this value is determined when an order is created.

      - Price of the quantity range.
        Some formulas set a price based on defined product quantity ranges.

      For more information, see [Price formulas](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/billing/pricing-formulas/).
