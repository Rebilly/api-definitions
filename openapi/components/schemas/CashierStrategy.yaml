      calculator:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Cashier amounts calculator.
          This field specifies if amounts are calculated using an absolute or percentage calculation.

          Amounts are specified in `baseAmount`, and increments are specified in `increments`.

          Example: `baseAmount: 10` and `increments: [20, 50, 100]`.

          - If the calculator is set to `absolute`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 30, 60, 110]`.
          - If the calculator is set to `percent`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 12, 15, 20]`.

          - absolute
          - percent

      increments:

        description: |-
          List of incremental amounts that are displayed to customer.

      adjustBaseToLastDeposit:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          Specifies if the base amount must be adjusted based on the last deposit.
          If this value is `true`, the `baseAmount` is changed to the last successful deposit amount made using [Create a cashier request](../PostCashierRequest).

          If the customer has no successful deposits, `baseAmount` is not adjusted.
  customAmount:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Custom amount restrictions.
      If this value is `null`,  custom amounts are prohibited.
      If `customAmount` is not specified when a cashier is created, amount restrictions are determined from the chosen strategy.
      For more information, see the [`strategyId` property](../PostCashierRequest#!path=strategyId&t=request).

          Multiple by which the custom amount increases.

          For example, if `minimum` is equal to 5.30, and `multipleOf` is 0.50, the valid custom amount is 5.30, 5.80, 6.30, 6.80 and so on until the `maximum` value is reached.

          A valid custom amount must be equal to `minimum` + X * `multipleOf`, where X is any non negative integer.
