  redirectUrl:
    description: |-
      URL where the customer is redirected when a KYC document upload is complete.
      When the customer is redirected,
      Rebilly appends an `info` query parameter that has one of the following values:
        - `back`: Customer clicked the `back to website` link.
        - `token_expired`: Customer's token expired.
        - `success`: Customer uploaded KYC documents that have been analyzed.
        - `manual`: Customer uploaded KYC documents that require a manual review.
          This is because the analyzer rejected the documents or could not process them.
        - `partial`: Some of the customer's KYC documents have been analyzed,
          but other documents have not.
          For example, this may occur when a proof of address document is analyzed but proof of ID is not.

      Example: `https://example.com?info=success`.
