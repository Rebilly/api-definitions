      This field specifies if amounts are calculated using an absolute or percentage calculation.

      Amounts are specified in `baseAmount`, and increments are specified in `increments`.

      Example: `baseAmount: 10` and `increments: [20, 50, 100]`.

      - If the calculator is set to `absolute`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 30, 60, 110]`.
      - If the calculator is set to `percent`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 12, 15, 20]`.

      Specifies if the base amount must be adjusted based on the last deposit.
      If this value is `true`, the `baseAmount` is changed to the last successful deposit amount made using [Create a cashier request](../PostCashierRequest).

      If the customer has no successful deposits, `baseAmount` is not adjusted.
