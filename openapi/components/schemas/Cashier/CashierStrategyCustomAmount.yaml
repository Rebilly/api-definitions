      Custom amount restrictions.
      If this value is `null`,  custom amounts are prohibited.
      If `customAmount` is not specified when a cashier is created, amount restrictions are determined from the chosen strategy.
      For more information, see the [`strategyId` property](#!path=strategyId&t=request).

      Multiple by which the custom amount increases.

      For example, if `minimum` is equal to 5.30, and `multipleOf` is 0.50, the valid custom amount is 5.30, 5.80, 6.30, 6.80 and so on until the `maximum` value is reached.

      A valid custom amount must be equal to `minimum` + X * `multipleOf`, where X is any non negative integer.
