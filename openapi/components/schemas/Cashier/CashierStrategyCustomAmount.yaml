      Custom amount restrictions.
      If this value is `null`,  custom amounts are prohibited.
      If `customAmount` is not specified when a cashier is created,
      amount restrictions are determined from a randomly selected strategy with a matching `filter` value.

      Multiple by which the custom amount increases.

      For example, if `minimum` is equal to 5.3, and `multipleOf` is 0.5, the valid custom amount is 5.3, 5.8, 6.3, 6.8 and so on until the `maximum` value is reached.

      A valid custom amount must be equal to `minimum` + X * `multipleOf`, where X is any non negative integer.
