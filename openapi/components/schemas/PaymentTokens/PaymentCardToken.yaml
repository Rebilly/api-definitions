  Creates a payment card token. A payment card token is a string that
  represents a customer's payment card details. It can be used once,
  and expires upon first use or within 30 minutes of token creation.
  To generate a full payment card token, you must provide the `billingAddress`.
  If `billingAddress` is not provided, the token can not be used for payments.
