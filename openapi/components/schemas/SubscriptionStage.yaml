  Subscription stage is a sequence of periods (up to infinite) of a subscription with the given settings
  which can be followed by another stage with different subscription settings.
  A stage change is similar to a new subscription creation, but with the same ID and following period number.

  A stage with number 1 is always implicitly created when the subscription order is created,
  but the concept is not applicable for one-time sales.

  A new stage may create a separate invoice if there are postpaid items on the given stage,
  before moving to the next stage with the appropriate initial invoice.

  A new stage can be created for a canceled or a churned subscription.
  If the subscription is churned, it becomes "pending" until the start date as if it is recreated.

          For more information, see [Coupons](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/settings/coupons-and-discounts/).

          This parameter uses the following logic:

          - If null or nothing is supplied, applied coupons are not changed.
          - If an empty array is supplied, all applied coupon redemptions are canceled.
          - If a list of coupons is supplied, non-applied coupons in the list are applied.
            Coupons that have already been applied do not change state.
            Applied coupons that are not supplied in list are canceled.

          If the list of applied coupons on a pending order is changed by this parameter during an order update, the invoice for the order is reissued.
