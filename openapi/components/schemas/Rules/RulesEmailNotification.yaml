      The message version (useful for split tests). By default is empty, but if
      you make multiple versions, you can name or number them to distinguish
      them.
  weight:

    description: >
      The value for random-weighted picking of a template in the case of a split
      test.

      The split test algorithm does not factor localization when making a
      weighted-random template selection.  Therefore, a version will be selected
      first, and then after a version is selected a specific localization will
      be selected.  Take the case where two versions have  different locale
      content -- the locales of the content is not considered when selecting the
      version.

  templates:
    description: >
      An array of message templates with the language locale identifiers
      according to [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646). A language
      will be selected based on the customer's locale.


      If there is no locale set for the customer, then `en-US` (US English) will
      be used as the locale.


      If there is no template with the customer's locale,  then a template
      locale will be selected by Rebilly using a closest match algorithm (which
      may be random at worst).


      If your email message templates are localized into more than one
      language,  you SHOULD set a customer locale.


      An invalid placeholder will render to an empty string. For example, `Hello
      {{invalid.placeholder}}!`  will be rendered to `Hello !`.
