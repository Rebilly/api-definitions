    description: |-
      Weight distribution value that is assigned to a template for a split test.
      Each template in a split test can be assigned a weight.
      The higher the weight value, the more likely the message template will be used.

      The split test algorithm does not assess locale when making a weighted template selection.

  templates:
    description: |-
      Array of message templates with language locale identifiers in [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) format.
      A language is selected based on the customer's locale.

      If no locale is configured for the customer, `en-US` (US English) is used.

      If no template is available in the customer's locale,
      a template locale is selected using a closest match algorithm.

      If your email message templates are localized into more than one language,
      set a customer locale.

      Invalid placeholders render as an empty strings. For example, `Hello
      {{invalid.placeholder}}!` is rendered as `Hello !`.
