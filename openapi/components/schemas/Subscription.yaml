      This parameter uses the following logic:

      - If this parameter is not supplied, applied coupons are not changed.
      - If an empty array is supplied, all applied coupon redemptions are canceled.
      - If a list of coupons is supplied, unapplied coupons in the list are applied.
        Coupons that have already been applied do not change state.
        Applied coupons that are not supplied in list are canceled.

      If the list of applied coupons on a pending order is changed by this parameter during an order update, the invoice for the order is reissued.
