          When the reported usage reaches 75%, 90%, and 100% of the configured limit a specific event is fired.
          To notify the customer, a webhook and notification can be configured for this event.
          This field is useful for accounting and customer success purposes.
          The usage of metered billing plans can still be reported if the soft limit is reached.

          a webhook and notification can be configured for this event.
          When the total usage reaches the hard limit quantity,

      This parameter uses the following logic:

      - If this parameter is not supplied, applied coupons are not changed.
      - If an empty array is supplied, all applied coupon redemptions are canceled.
      - If a list of coupons is supplied, unapplied coupons in the list are applied.
        Coupons that have already been applied do not change state.
        Applied coupons that are not supplied in list are canceled.

      If the list of applied coupons on a pending order is changed by this parameter during an order update, the invoice for the order is reissued.
