      - If the `delinquencyPeriod` value is `null`, the order does not change state and remains active.
      You must explicitly configure the delinquency period to enable automatic cancellation of unpaid orders.
      - If you add a delinquency period to an active order, it is applied to all new invoices created for the order. It is not applied to the unpaid and past-due invoices. To apply a delinquency period to unpaid and past-due invoices, set the `delinquencyTime` parameter using the [upsert an invoice API operation](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/invoices/putinvoice#invoices/putinvoice/t=request&path=delinquencytime).

      an [order delinquency period](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/organizations/patchorganization#organizations/patchorganization/t=request&path=settings/billing/orderdelinquencyperiod) setting is used to calculate the value.
