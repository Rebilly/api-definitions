  effectiveTime:
    description: |-
      Date at which the service period pauses.

      This time should be later than the current time, if it is earlier then current time is taken.

      If omitted, it defaults to the current time.

  endTime:
    description: |-
      Time when the pause ends and the subscription resumes its billing.

      In order to resume a subscription now, use current time or past time (defaults to the current time).
      Empty `endTime` results in an indefinitely paused subscription.

  timeRemaining:
    description: |-
      Time period between the pause end time and the renewal time in ISO-8601 durations format.
      By default, it's computed as the time between the pause and the renewal.

      For instance, you have a $30/month subscription and 30-day month.
      If you pause on day 20 of the subscription, there are 10 days unused.
      Therefore, the subscription would renew in 10 days after resuming.
      The upcoming invoice would not change the amount for invoiced period, it remains $30.
      There may be a billing anchor for the subscription,
      the renewal time after a pause shift should behave as if the renewal time moved forward with Order API
      (the billing anchor is ignored for that period then).
