            new:
              description: |-
                Occurs when new customers sign up.
                New ARR is the amount of the new customer's subscription.

                Example: A new customer signs up to a $40 per month plan.
                This is a new ARR amount of $480 ($40 multiplied by 12 months).
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 480.0
            reactivation:
              description: |-
                Occurs when a customer stops being a customer for a period but later signs up again.
                Reactivation ARR is the amount of the customer's new subscription.

                Example: A customer cancels their subscription, but signs up again and purchases a $25 per month plan.
                This is a reactivation ARR amount of $300 ($25 multiplied by 12 months).
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 300.0
            churned:
              description: |-
                Occurs when a subscription is churned.
                Churn occurs when the paid service period on a subscription order expires.
                Churned ARR is the amount that is lost as a result of the churned subscription.

                Example: When a subscription is churned, the value of a subscription goes from $80 per month to $0 per month.
                This is a churned ARR amount of $960 ($80 multiplied by 12 months).
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 960.0
            contraction:
              description: |-
                Occurs when an existing customer changes items which result in a smaller ARR.
                Contraction ARR is the amount before the change minus the amount after the change.

                Example: A customer downgrades from a plan that is $100 per month to plan that is $80 per month.
                This is a contraction ARR amount of $240 ($20 multiplied by 12 months).
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 240.0
            expansion:
              description: |-
                Occurs when existing customers change items which result in a bigger ARR.
                Expansion ARR is the amount after the change minus the amount before the change.

                Example: A customer upgrades from a plan that is $40 per month to a plan that is $100 per month.
                This is an expansion ARR amount of $720 ($60 multiplied by 12 months).
              type: number
              format: double
              example: 720.0
