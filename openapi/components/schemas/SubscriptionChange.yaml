  renewalPolicy:
    description: >-
      The value determines whether the subscription retains its current
      `renewalTime` or resets it to a newly calculated `renewalTime`.
    type: string
    enum:
      - reset
      - retain
  prorated:
    description: >
      Whether or not to give a pro rata credit for the amount of time remaining
      between the `effectiveTime` and the end of the current period.

      In addition, if the `renewalTime` is retained (by setting the
      `renewalPolicy` to `retain`), then a pro rata debit will occur as well,

      for the amount between the `effectiveTime` and the `renewalTime` as a
      percentage of the normal period size.
    type: boolean
  effectiveTime:
    description: >-
      The date from which the renewal time (for `reset` operations) and
      proration calculations are made.  If omitted, it will default to the
      current time.

    format: date-time
  preview:

      If set to true, it will not change the subscription.  It allows for a way
      to preview the changes that would be made to a subscription.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  keepTrial:
    description: >-
      If set to true and the subscription order has an active trial, it will use that trial further. Works with 'retain'
      renewalPolicy only.
    type: boolean
    default: false
