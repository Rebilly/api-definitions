      - $ref: ./ResourceId.yaml
  quantity:
    description: >-
      Number of units of the product on the given plan. If null or omitted,

    type: integer
  renewalPolicy:

      - retain
  prorated:
    description: >
      Whether or not to give a pro rata credit for the amount of time remaining
      between the `effectiveTime` and the end of the current period.

      In addition, if the `renewalTime` is retained (by setting the
      `renewalPolicy` to `retain`), then a pro rata debit will occur as well,

      for the amount between the `effectiveTime` and the `renewalTime` as a
      percentage of the normal period size.
    type: boolean
  effectiveTime:
    description: >-
      The date from which the renewal time (for `reset` operations) and
