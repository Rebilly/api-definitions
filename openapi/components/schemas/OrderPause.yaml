  effectiveTime:
    description: |-
      Date and time when the service period pauses.

      This time must be later than the current time.
      If this time is earlier then the current time, the current time is used.

      If this field is omitted, this value defaults to the current time.

  endTime:
    description: |-
      Date and time when the pause ends and the order resumes billing.

      To resume a order from this point in time,
      use the current time or an earlier time.
      If `endTime` is earlier then the current time, the current time is used.
      If this field is empty, the order is indefinitely paused.

    format: date-time
  timeRemaining:
    description: |-
      Amount of time between the pause end time and the renewal time in ISO-8601 durations format.
      By default, this value is computed as the time between the pause and the renewal.

      Example: A $30 per month subscription on a 30-day month is paused on day 20 of the order.
      There are 10 unused days on the order.
      Therefore, the order renews in 10 days after it is resumed.
      The upcoming invoice does not change the amount for the invoiced period, it remains at $30.
      If the order uses a billing anchor,
      the renewal time after a pause shift behaves as though the renewal time is moved forward by an [Order API operation](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/orders),
      and the billing anchor is ignored for that period.

      For more information, see [Service period anchor, billing timing, and invoice time shift](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/concepts/#service-period-anchor-and-billing-timing-and-invoice-time-shift).
