          This field specifies if amounts are calculated using an absolute or percentage calculation.

          Amounts are specified in `baseAmount`, and increments are specified in `increments`.

          Example: `baseAmount: 10` and `increments: [20, 50, 100]`.

          - If the calculator is set to `absolute`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 30, 60, 110]`.
          - If the calculator is set to `percent`: the amounts displayed to the customer are `[10, 12, 15, 20]`.

      adjustBaseToLastDeposit:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          Specifies if the base amount must be adjusted based on the last deposit.
          If this value is `true`, the `baseAmount` is changed to the last successful deposit amount made using [Create a deposit request](https://www.rebilly.com/catalog/all/deposits/postdepositrequest).

          If the customer has no successful deposits, `baseAmount` is not adjusted.
      hideBaseAmount:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          Specifies if the base amount is hidden in the deposit form options.
          If this value is `true`, the base amount is used to calculate increments but is not shown as a selectable option.

    description: |-
      Custom amount restrictions.
