      Property weights that are used for the KYC document verification process.

      All KYC documents start the verification process with a score of 100.
      If a check fails, the score is reduced by the corresponding weight.
      For example, if the `firstName` check weight is set to `5`, and the check fails,
      the KYC document score becomes `95`.
