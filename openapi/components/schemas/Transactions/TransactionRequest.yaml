          The type of transaction requested.

          You should always include the type within your API request.

          This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.  To refund or void,
          use the refund endpoint.

          To `capture` use the `sale` type. If any existing `authorize` transactions
          are eligible, then they will be captured and the `sale` will be converted
          to a `capture` type.

          The `setup` type will set up the payment instrument by following the `setupInstruction` in the selected gateway account.
          If the instruction is to `do-nothing`, a transaction with result `approved` of type `setup` will be returned.
