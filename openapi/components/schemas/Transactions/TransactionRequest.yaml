          Specifies whether to create or update (upsert) a customer.

          Type of transaction.

          This field supports a limited subset of transaction types.
          To refund or void, see [Refund a transaction](../PostTransactionRefund).

          To `capture`, use the `sale` type.
          If any existing `authorize` transactions are eligible,
          they are captured and the `sale` converts to a `capture` type.

          The `setup` type sets up the payment instrument by following the `setupInstruction` in the selected gateway account.
          If the instruction is to `do-nothing`, a transaction with result `approved` of type `setup` returns.
