          Type of transaction.

          This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.
          To refund or void, use the refund endpoint.

          To `capture` use the `sale` type.
          If any existing `authorize` transactions are eligible,
          then they are captured and the `sale` converts to a `capture` type.

          The `setup` type sets up the payment instrument by following the `setupInstruction` in the selected gateway account.
          If the instruction is to `do-nothing`, a transaction with result `approved` of type `setup` returns.
