      The type of transaction requested.

      You should always include the type within your API request.

      This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.  To refund or void,
      use the refund endpoint.

      To `capture` use the `sale` endpoint.  It will capture if there are any
      eligible

      transactions of type `authorize` that can be captured.
    type: string
    enum:
      - sale
      - authorize
      - credit
  amount:
    description: >
      The transaction amount.  Use `0` for a zero dollar verification. This is
      important if

      you want to authorize a payment instrument before giving access to a free
      trial, for example.
    type: number
    format: double
    example: 97.97
  invoiceIds:
    description: >
      The array of invoice identifiers.  It's important to note that the
      transaction

      amount can be more or less than the combined invoice amounts.  If the
      transaction

      is a type `sale` and it is `approved` it will be applied to these invoices
      in

      the order of the first issued invoice to the most recently issued
      invoice.  If

      there are enough funds to fully pay an invoice, the invoice status will be
      marked

      as paid.

  requestId:
    description: >-
      The request id is **recommended**. It prevents duplicate transaction
      requests within a short period of time. If a duplicate request is sent
      with the same `requestId` it will be ignored to prevent double-billing
      anyone.  It must be unique within a 24-hour period.  We recommend
      generating a UUID v4 as its value.

      follow with a `GET` request to confirm the result of the transaction.
      Please respond with a `2xx`

      HTTP status code, or we will reattempt the request again.

      You may use `{id}` or `{result}` as placeholders in the URL and we will replace them with the transaction's id and result accordingly.
