      Specifies whether to create or update (upsert) a customer.

      Type of transaction.

      This field supports a limited subset of transaction types.
      To refund or void, see [Refund a transaction](../PostTransactionRefund).

      To `capture`, use the `sale` type.
      If any existing `authorize` transactions are eligible,
      they are captured and the `sale` converts to a `capture` type.

      The `setup` type sets up the payment instrument by following the `setupInstruction` in the selected gateway account.
      If the instruction is to `do-nothing`, a transaction with result `approved` of type `setup` returns.
