        weight:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Weight distribution value that is assigned to a template for a split test.
            Each template in a split test can be assigned a weight.
            The higher the weight value, the more likely the message template is used.

            The split test algorithm does not assess locale when making a weighted template selection.
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 100
          example: 75
          default: 100

          description: |-
            Split test templates.

            Use split tests to determine which content is most effective.
            Split tests send variations of the same message to different customers or leads.
            You can then send the winning message to the remaining customers or leads.
