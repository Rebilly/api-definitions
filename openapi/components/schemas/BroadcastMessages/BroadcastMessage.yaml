      The filter that will be used on customer selection during the broadcast

      The syntax is the same as the `query` filter, without `filter=` prefix.

      For example: `firstName:John`, `firstName:John;lastName:Doe`, etc.

      Attention: You should not URL encode the filter value.
    example: 'firstName:John;lastName:Doe'

            The value for random-weighted picking of a template in the case of a
            split test.

            The split test algorithm does not factor localization when making a
            weighted-random template selection.  Therefore, a version will be
            selected first, and then after a version is selected a specific
            localization will be selected.  Take the case where two versions
            have different locale content -- the locales of the content is not
            considered when selecting the version.
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 100
