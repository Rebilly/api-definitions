  subscriptionId:
    type: string
    description: |-
      ID of the reactivated subscription.

      If this subscription has a canceled status hence still active
      then the reactivation is effectively "canceling" the ongoing cancellation.

      If this subscription has a churned status hence inactive then
      the reactivation is more like starting a new subscription
      with the same parameters and ID, but no setup fees and trial,
      and with the next service period number after the cancellation.

    nullable: true
    maxLength: 255
  effectiveTime:
    description: |-
      Date and time when the service period starts, unless the subscription is canceled but still active.

      If the subscription is still active then this field is ignored
      and the subscription status moves back to "active" immediately.

      If the subscription is churned then this time behaves like `startTime` of the subscriptions order:
      the new service period starts since the effective time which can be in future
      or in the recent past, but no more than one service period in the past.

      If this field is omitted, this value defaults to the current time.

    writeOnly: true
  renewalTime:
    description: |-
      Date and time of the next subscription renewal.
      If this field is omitted, this value is computed from the `effectiveTime` field.

      Specifying this field has the same effect as specifying `renewalTime` for a subscription order directly.
    type: string
    format: date-time
  paymentInstrumentId:
    writeOnly: true
    description: |-
      ID of the payment instrument.
      If this field is omitted, the subscription payment instrument remains unchanged.
