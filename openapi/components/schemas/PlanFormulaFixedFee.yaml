      Price formula that determines which algorithm is used to calculate the invoice price based on the following factors:

      - Quantity in the order.
        This value may be variable if you are charging based on usage.
        If you are not charging based on usage,
        this value is determined when an order is created.

      - Price of the quantity range.
        Some formulas set a price based on defined product quantity ranges.

      For more information, see [Price formulas](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/billing/pricing-formulas/).

      Use this formula to charge for subscriptions that have a fixed price,
      number of units, and reoccur over a fixed period of time,
      such as every: day, week, month, year, or number of years.

      For example, a streaming company charges customers $13.99 each month for subscription period that is 6 months in duration.
      The quantity of movies that a customer streams each month does not impact the price.
