  Use invoice time shift to control the billing time.

  Invoice time shift adjusts the invoice issue and due date when billing must occur before the service period changes.

  Use invoice time shift in conjunction with `billingTiming` to:

  - Bill immediately when the service period starts.
  - Bill immediately after the service period ends.
  - Bill at an interval of time before the service period starts.
  - Bill at an interval of time after the service period starts.
  - Bill at an interval of time before the service period ends.
  - Bill at an interval of time after the service period ends.

      This is used in conjunction with the service period anchor to calculate
      the time at which the invoice is issued. For more information, see

      Calculation instruction of the invoice due time.

      This is used in conjunction with the billing anchor to calculate when
      an invoice is due for payment. For more information, see

      The sequential order of due time shift is always after the due date.
