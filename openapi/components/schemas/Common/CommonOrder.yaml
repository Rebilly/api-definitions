      Read more about [coupons here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/dashboard/marketing/coupons-and-discounts/).

      This parameter respects the following logic:

      - When not passed then applied coupons are not changed.
      - When empty array passed then all applied coupon redemptions are canceled.
      - When list of coupons is passed then not applied yet coupons are applied, already applied coupons do not changed their state, applied coupons that are not presented in
      passed list are canceled.

      If list of applied coupons on pending order are changed due to this param during update order, the invoice for the order is reissued.
