      here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/dashboard/marketing/coupons-and-discounts/).


      This parameter respects the following logic:


      - When not passed then applied coupons will not be changed.


      - When empty array passed then all applied coupon redemptions will be
      canceled.


      - When list of coupons is passed then not applied yet coupons will be
      applied, already applied coupons

      will not change their state, applied coupons that are not presented in
      passed list will be canceled.


      If list of applied coupons on pending order will be changed due to
      this param during update order,
       Invoice for the order will be reissued.
