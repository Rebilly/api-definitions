            Date when the service period pauses.

            This time should be later than the current time.
            If this time is earlier then the current time, the current time is used.

            If this field is omitted, this value defaults to the current time.

        endTime:
          description: |-
            Time when the pause ends and the subscription resumes billing.

            To resume a subscription from this point in time,
            use the current time or an earlier time.
            If `endTime` is earlier then the current time, the current time is used.
            If this field is empty, the subscription is indefinitely paused.

        timeRemaining:
          description: |-
            Amount of time between the pause end time and the renewal time in ISO-8601 durations format.
            By default, this value is computed as the time between the pause and the renewal.

            Example: A $30 per month subscription on a 30-day month is paused on day 20 of the subscription.
            There are 10 unused days on the subscription.
            Therefore, the subscription renews in 10 days after it is resumed.
            The upcoming invoice does not change the amount for the invoiced period, it remains at $30.
            If the subscription uses a billing anchor,
            the renewal time after a pause shift behaves as though the renewal time is moved forward by an [Order API operation](../../tag/Orders),
            and the billing anchor is ignored for that period.
