                Defines thresholds for notification purposes.
                For example, to notify the customer that their usage is near the hard limit of their metered billing plan.
                This notification informs the customer so that they can upgrade their plan before the hard limit is reached.
                When the reported usage reaches 75%, 90%, and 100% of the configured limit a specific event is fired.
                To notify the customer, a webhook and notification can be configured for this event.
                This field is useful for accounting and customer success purposes.
                The usage of metered billing plans can still be reported if the soft limit is reached.

                When a soft limit is reached,
                a customer may receive a notification
                but the service can still be provided up to the hard limit value so that the customer can upgrade their plan.
                When the reported usage reaches the configured limit,
                a specific event is triggered.
                To notify the customer in the merchant system,
                or block a service,
                a webhook and notification can be configured for this event.
                When the total usage reaches the hard limit quantity,
                or amount values,
                metered billing plan usages can no longer be reported.
