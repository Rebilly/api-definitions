            If this value is `true`, the operation creates or updates (upserts) a customer.

            Type of transaction.

            This field supports a limited subset of transaction types.
            To refund or void, see [Refund a transaction](../PostTransactionRefund).

            To `capture`, use the `sale` type.
            If any existing `authorize` transactions are eligible,
            they are captured and the `sale` converts to a `capture` type.

            The `setup` type sets up the payment instrument by following the `setupInstruction` in the selected gateway account.
            If the instruction is to `do-nothing`, a transaction with result `approved` of type `setup` returns.
          type: string
