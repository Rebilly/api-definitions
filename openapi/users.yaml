    # Introduction
    This document covers APIs mostly intended for consumption by Rebilly's
    Frontend GUI [app](https://app.rebilly.com).  However, any client is welcome
    to use these APIs.  Our main API docs can be [found here](https://api-reference.rebilly.com/).

    The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
    you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
    or [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).

    # Authentication
    When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
    You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
    need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
    Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

    Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.
    - [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure
    - [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for requests from the client side.
    - [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time

    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    # SDKs

    ## Javascript SDK

    Installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/sdks).
    SDK code examples are included in these docs.

    ## PHP SDK
    For all PHP SDK examples provided in this spec you will need to configure `$client`.
    You may do it like this:

    ```php
    $client = new Rebilly\Client([
        'apiKey' => 'YourApiKeyHere',
        'baseUrl' => 'https://api.rebilly.com',
    ]);
    ```

    # Using filter with collections
    Rebilly provides collections filtering. You can use `?filter` param on collection to define which records should be shown in the response.

    Here is filter format description:

    - Fields and values in filter are separated with `:`: `?filter=firstName:John`.

    - Fields in filter are separated with `;`: `?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe`.

    - You can use multiple values using `,` as values separator: `?filter=firstName:John,Bob`.

    - To negate the filter use `!`: `?filter=firstName:!John`. Note that you can negate multiple values like this: `?filter=firstName:!John,Bob`. This filter rule will exclude all Johns and Bobs from the response.

    - You can use range filters like this: `?filter=amount:1..10`.

    - You can use gte (greater than or equals) filter like this: `?filter=amount:1..`, or lte (less than or equals) than filter like this: `?filter=amount:..10`.

    - You can create some [predefined values lists](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/Lists) and use them in filter: `?filter=firstName:@yourListName`. You can also exclude list values: `?filter=firstName:!@yourListName`.

  - name: API Keys
    description: |
      Always keep your API Keys private. When creating your API keys,
      you can restrict them to a given set of permissions.
      In addition to your API Keys, you may use
      JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate to the API.  See
      our [Sessions](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/JWT-Session) resource for more information.
  - name: Balance transactions
    description: |
      Balance transactions API.

      This API is experimental and not guaranteed to be backward compatible.
  - name: Billing Portals
    description: |
      Customer billing portals can be configured here. You can customize various
      options that appear on your billing portals.
  - name: Checkout Forms
    description: |
      Hosted checkout forms can be configured here. You can customize various
      options that appear on your hosted checkout forms.
  - name: Email Credentials
    description: |
      Get and create SMTP credential hashes.
  - name: Gateway Accounts
    description: |
      Gateway accounts connect payment request to third party networks and platforms.
  - name: Lists
    description: |
      Lists contain sets of values and may be referenced within Rules criteria.

      List order may not be maintained and duplicates may be removed.

      You may grant permissions to edit Lists to different people than those who can edit Rules.
      It may be useful if your workflow involves frequent updates to value sets used in criteria.
  - name: Organizations
    description: |
      Organization is an entity that represents you, or your company, as a merchant. You can have multiple organizations.

      Note: Organizations are shared between "Live" and "Sandbox" environments.
  - name: Profile
    description: |
      A Profile represents the person currently logged in to Rebilly.
  - name: Rebilly API
    description: |
      The Rebilly API is the main API commonly integrated by 3rd parties.  You may see
      the [Rebilly API Documentation here](https://api-reference.rebilly.com).
  - name: Reports API
    description: |
      The Rebilly Reporting API is currently experimental.  You may see
      the [Reports API Documentation here](https://reports-api-docs.rebilly.com).
  - name: Reset password
    description: |
      When a password reset is requested, an email with a token is sent. Upon receiving the email
      the user then needs to click a link and choose a new password.
  - name: Rules
    description: |
      "Don't conform to the rules. Create the rules."
      Rather than adapt your workflow and business, Rebilly can align with your business
      objectives by giving you the power to automate certain behaviors when key events happen.
      You can use this to your advantage to mitigate risk, maximize conversions and minimize costs.
      You have the controls at your fingertips here. If you need more control,
      or help dialing in on a strategy, feel free to contact us.

      When an event happens, it triggers the evaluation of conditions (that you set up),
      in order from top to bottom. If the condition is met, the corresponding actions are executed.
      The conditions continue to be checked until either all of the conditions have been executed,
      or a special "stop" action is executed.
  - name: JWT Session
    description: |
      A session contains a token, which is a JSON Web Token.  The token is created
      with a user's signin credentials.

      This token can be used to authenticate to the API.  In addition, the session can be set to
      expire at a particular time. Use the token to then authenticate for further requests to the Rebilly API.

      The token should be kept private, but could be stored on the user's browser
      client to simulate a "session".
  - name: Status
    description: |
      Check the status of the Rebilly API (no authentication required).
  - name: Tracking
    description: |
      Tracking is a layer for accessing all the activity (API requests,
      subscriptions, webhooks, events, etc.), thus providing easier
      debugging and issues auditing.
  - name: Users
    description: |
      A User represents a person who can login to Rebilly, and take actions subject to
      their granted permissions.
  - name: Websites
    description: |
      A Website represents the website/brand that customers interact with... You
      could think of it like a brand.  For example, Nestle owns Perrier and Purina
      and PowerBar.

      We recognize that some enterprises have more than one website (or brand).  The
      website is related to each invoice and each payment gateway account.  This feature
      would allow you to have gateway accounts that are related to multiple websites, or
      exclusive to particular websites.  And gives you more control over your business.
  - name: Webhook Credentials
    description: |
      Get and create Webhook credential hashes.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      Webhooks are designed to notify your systems when certain/all registered events happen in near real-time.
      They allow you to collect information about those events. Rebilly can send these information via
      POST to an URL of your choice.
  - name: Segments
    description: |
      Segments are grid UI settings that can be shared with other users. They are like a custom view.
      For example, one may set up a transaction grid to show specific columns and sort a certain way, and share it with
      others in their organization.
  - name: Memberships
    description: |
      Membership describe the relationships between organizations and users.
      For example, one user could have more than one organization.
  - name: Roles
    description: |
      Roles are an implementation of the general hierarchical RBAC. A senior role inherits all of it's juniors' ACLs plus its own ACL.
      Junior roles are not influenced by the senior role.
