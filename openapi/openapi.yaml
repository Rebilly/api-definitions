      Blocklists are lists of customer attribute values that are blocked from buying from you.
      For example, if a customer attempts to make a purchase from you with a credit card that is in a blocklist, the transaction is blocked and is not processed.

      Before a new transaction is processed in Rebilly, blocklists are examined to check for attributes related to the entity.
      If a match is detected, the operation is aborted.
      A blocklist that expires after a period of time is called a greylist.
  - name: Broadcast messages
    description: |-
      Use broadcast messages to notify customers and leads about upcoming promotions, service updates, and events.
      Broadcast messages are emails that are sent to a specific group of customers, or all customers.

  - name: Coupons
    description: |-
      Use coupons to reward customers, generate sales, or to test new pricing strategies.
      Coupons enable you to apply different types of discounts to invoices, subscriptions, and pricing plans.

      Redeemed coupons are attached to a customer's account.
      Depending on the coupon restrictions, the redeemed coupons are then applied from the customer's account to subsequent invoices or subscriptions.
      Redeemed coupons can only be applied to invoices of the same currency.

      Once a coupon is redeemed it cannot be modified.
      You may deactivate a coupon or create a new coupon, but you cannot reuse the same coupon code.
      If you have a use case where you must reuse the same code, [contact Rebilly](https://www.rebilly.com/contact/).

      ### Coupon restriction types

      The following coupon description types are available:

      - `restrict-to-countries`: Restricts a coupon for use in specific countries.
      - `discounts-per-redemption`: Restricts the number of times that the coupon can be applied by one redemption.
        For example, use this restriction to configure a coupon that can only be applied to the first subscription renewal of a particular product.
      - `minimum-order-amount`: Sets a minimum order amount for a coupon application.
        For example, if the restriction amount is $20, the coupon is only applied to invoices with a total amount of $20 or more.
      - `restrict-to-invoices`: Restricts a coupon to specific invoices.
      - `restrict-to-plans`: Restricts a coupon to specific pricing plans.
      - `restrict-to-subscriptions`: Restricts a coupon to specific order subscriptions.
      - `restrict-to-products`: Restricts a coupon to specific products.
      - `paid-by-time`: Specifies a date and time at which a coupon redemption expires if not paid.
      - `redemptions-per-customer`: Restricts the number of times that a coupon can be redeemed by one customer.
        For example, use this restriction to limit the number of redemptions to one per customer.
      - `total-redemptions`: Restricts the number of times a coupon can be redeemed by different customers.
      - `restrict-to-bxgy`: Provides "buy X get Y" promotions.
        These promotions incentivize new customers to buy and also reward existing customers.
        This restriction type enables you to add discounted plans to an invoice when a certain quantity of other plans are purchased.
        For example, if a customer buys two or more books, they get one free bookmark.
  - name: Credit memos
    description: |-
      Use credit memos to provide a customer with store credit.
      A common use case for using a credit memo is to provide a customer with store credit,
      rather than a refund, if the customer pays more than they owe or returns a product.
      For information on the credit memo resource, see [Resources](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/concepts/#resources).
  - name: Credit memos timeline
    description: |-

    description: |-
      Use custom domains to configure and use your own domain for forms and billing portals,
      instead of the default Rebilly domain: `portal.secure-payments.app`.
      For more information, see [Configure a custom domain](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/settings/organizations-and-websites#configure-a-custom-domain).
  - name: Custom fields
    description: |-
      Use custom fields to extend a resource scheme to include custom data that is not provided as a common field.
      Depending on the resource on which the custom field is added, it may be available in the Rebilly UI.

      Example: A custom field called `preferredCommunicationChannel` is added to the customer resource.
      It has two allowed values, which are 'email' and 'phone'.

      ```js
      {
        "customFields": {
            "preferredCommunicationChannel": "email"
        }
      }
      ```

  - name: Disputes
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage disputes.
      A dispute occurs when a customer contests a charge to their account.
      The dispute and related information is made available to the merchant by the bank or credit card company.
      The merchant then has the option to represent the charge and win the case.
      This process is called dispute resolution.
      If the merchant is unable to represent the charge, the card issuer typically reverses the sale and adds fees on top of the charge.
      This process is called a chargeback.

      A session contains a token, which is a JSON Web Token.
      The token is created with a user's sign in credentials.

      This token can be used to authenticate to the API.
      In addition, the session can be set to expire at a particular time.
      Use the token to authenticate further requests to the Rebilly API.

      The token must be kept private, but can be stored on the user's browser client to simulate a "session".
  - name: KYC documents
    description: |-
      Use Know Your Customer (KYC) documents to verify your customers identity.
      The KYC document operations generate a signed link to the Rebilly [KYC document gatherer](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/kyc-and-aml/kyc-document-gatherer/).

      Document types:
        - `identity-proof`: Validates a customer's identity.
        - `address-proof`: Validates a customer's address.
        - `purchase-proof`: Validates a customer's purchase.
        - `funds-proof`: Validates that a customer has funds.
        - `credit-file-proof`: Verifies that there is an existing credit file with two sources that match the customer's name, DOB, and address.

      Rebilly parses and analyzes the documents and accepts or rejects them according to a configurable scoring algorithm.
      When all document types in a KYC request are accepted, the status is fulfilled, and the [KYC request fulfilled webhook](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/api/operation/kyc-request-fulfilled/) is sent.

      ### Credit file proof

      The `credit-file-proof` KYC document request type is only available in the API,
      this option is not available in the [KYC document gatherer](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/kyc-and-aml/kyc-document-gatherer/).
      This request verifies that there is an existing credit file with two sources that match the person's name, date of birth, and address.

      In Canada, to meet FINTRAC requirements, the `credit-file-proof` KYC document request verifies the customer's name, address, and date of birth with a credit agency.

      If `credit-file-proof` is requested in combination with `identity-proof` and `address-proof`,
      `credit-file-proof` is attempted first.
      If `credit-file-proof` validates the identity and address,
      the KYC request is considered fulfilled.
      If the request is not fulfilled,
      redirect your customer to the KYC document gatherer to collect their KYC documents.

  - name: Lists
    description: |-
      Use lists to create and maintain sets of values that may be referenced in rule conditions.
      Commonly used lists contain values related to conditions that target specific properties such as: customers, transactions, or BINs.

      You may grant list edit permissions to members of your team without enabling them to edit rules.
      This may be useful if your workflow involves frequent updates to value sets that are used in rule or bind conditions.
      List order may not be maintained and duplicates may be removed.

      Use rules to automate.
      In the Rebilly rules engine, an action is an operation that executes when an event occurs.
      Action and event conditions are defined in rules.
      Rulesets are collections of rules that are associated with an event.
      The order in which the rules are placed within a ruleset specifies the execution order.

      For a list of events and related actions, see [Events](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/automations/event-types/).
  - name: Rules timeline
    description: Use rule timelines to maintain an audit trail of changes and activity for each rule.
  - name: Search
    description: Use search operations to search data on customers, invoices, orders, transactions and more.
  - name: Segments
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage UI segments.
      A segment is a filtered view of a data set that can be shared with other users.
      For example, you may create a transactions segment that displays specific columns that are filtered and sorted based on certain criteria,
      and share it with others in your organization.
  - name: Shipping rates
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage shipping rates.
      A shipping rate contains a filter and a pricing for a specific shipping destination.
  - name: Status
    description: |-
      Use this operation to check the status of the Rebilly API.
      No authentication is required.
  - name: Tags
    description: Use tags to organize and categorize customers or KYC documents based on keywords.
  - name: TaxJar credentials
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage your TaxJar account credentials.
      The TaxJar integration enables you to calculate taxes and create transactions for the Sales Tax AutoFile feature in your TaxJar account.
      For more information, see [TaxJar integration](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/automations/tax-jar-integration/#taxjar-integration).
  - name: Tracking
    description: |-
      Use tracking when debugging and auditing issues.
      Tracking is a layer for accessing all activity such as:
      API requests, subscriptions, webhooks, events, and more.
  - name: Transactions
    description: |-
      Use these operations to:
        - set up payment instruments for payments
        - authorize and hold funds
        - capture funds
        - make payments
        - make payouts
        - refund transactions.
  - name: Transactions timeline
    description: Use transaction timelines to maintain an audit trail of changes and activity for each transaction.
  - name: Usage
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage the product usage of a subscription item for metered billing purposes.

      Use metered billing when product quantity is unknown to the customer at the moment of creating a subscription.
      Metered billing is based on reported usage records.
      Every reported usage updates the quantity of an upcoming invoice item for a specified subscription and a plan.
      To create a metered billing plan, see [Plans](../Plans).
  - name: Users
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage users.
      A user is a person who can login to Rebilly, and take actions based on their granted permissions.
  - name: Webhook credentials
    description: Use these operations to manage webhook credential hashes.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage webhooks.
      Webhooks notify your systems in real-time when certain events occur.
      For example, when a new transaction occurs or a new subscription is created.
      Webhooks enable you to collect information about events.
      Rebilly can send this information by HTTP POST request to a defined URL of your choice.
  - name: Websites
    description: |-
      Use these operations to manage websites.
      A website is where your organization obtains a customer.
      It is also the processor account and billing descriptor used for payment transactions.
      You can create multiple websites.

      Websites are related to each invoice and each payment gateway account.
      This enables you to associate gateway accounts with multiple websites,
      or make them exclusive to particular websites.
      For more information, see [My organizations and websites](https://www.rebilly.com/docs/settings/organizations-and-websites/).
